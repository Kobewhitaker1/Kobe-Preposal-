# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
 Some ideas that I have were to make a game, maybe a mario like platformer that will have the character avoid objects
 Making a pong game that would instead have the ball hit a block back and fourth and some other features
 or making a sensor that could send tweets after a certain task was done

no I dont plan to work with classmates 

## Do you have any questions of your own?

no not at this moment.
